            Hello, my name is Darien. I like to play videogames, eat food, and
            sometimes code. I am chinese but I was born and raised in Canada.
            Often times I find myself with very <em>little</em> sleep from
            browsing videos on <em>YouTube</em> for hours on end the night
            before. I am currently enrolled at BCIT in the computer information
            technology program.
          </p>
